# JS express API template

This is a basic template for building a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js. It provides a structured starting point for your API development, with essential components and best practices.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/js-express-api-template.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd js-express-api-template
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file and configure your environment variables. You can use the `.env.example` file as a starting point.

5. Start the server:
   1. For development:
      ```bash
      pnpm run dev
      ```
   2. For production:
       ```bash
      pnpm run start
      ```

Your API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project has the following directory structure:

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application.
  - `api/`: Contains the API code.
    - `controllers/`: Controllers for handling HTTP requests.
    - `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions.
    - `routes/`: API routes and endpoints.
    - `services/`: Business logic for the API.
    - `tasks/`: Scheduled tasks.
    - `validations/`: Request validation schemas.
  - `database/`: Configuration files for the project.
    - `config/`: Database configuration files.
    - `migrations/`: Database migration files.
    - `models/`: Database models and sequelize entry point.
    - `seeders/`: Database seed files.
    - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.
  - `lib/`: Custom libraries and utilities.
    - `handlers/`: Custom file abd route handlers.
    - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.
  - `tests/`: Test files and configurations for testing the API.
  - `app.js`: The entry point of the application.

## Usage

You can start building your API by adding controllers, models, and routes in the appropriate directories within the `src/` folder. The `express` framework is already set up for you, so you can create new routes and controllers as needed.

## Testing

The project includes a testing framework to help you write and run tests for your API. You can find example test files in the `tests/` directory. Use the following command to run the tests:

```bash
pnpm run test
```
Or for windows:
```bash
pnpm run test:win
```

You can also add more tests as you develop your API to ensure that it works as expected.
